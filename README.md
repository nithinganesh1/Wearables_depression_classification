# Wearables_depression_classification
This project aims to classify depression based on HRV data. After understanding the data it is observed that some features have less correlation compared to other features so we proceed with the feature selection and then did the EDA. We treated the missing values and outliers properly and then fit a Random Forest Classification to predict the stress. But only by analysing the stress we cannot say that the person is suffering from depression. so we proceed with researches and found out that RMSSD(Root mean square of successive differences) is also a factor for analysing depression. That is low RMSSD may indicate that the person is having depression. So after finding out the stress,we calculate depression by combining the conditions of high stress and low RMSSD. like wise we can predict the situations where a person shows the symptoms of depression.
